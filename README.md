# Chittak (Claude 3 + NTFY)

A Python script that watches your screenshots folder, extracts the top-left task from new images using **Claude 3 Vision**, and sends the answer to your **ntfy.sh** channel.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Monitors `~/Pictures/Screenshots` for new screenshots.
2. Whenever a new screenshot is taken, it sends the image to Claude 3 with a prompt to identify the task in the image and return the solution.
3. Sends the answer to `ntfy.sh` topic, which will show up on phone.
